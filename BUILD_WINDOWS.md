# Windows Build Guide

This fork's Windows QoL and Bug Fixes changes, including tray and autostart features, are already part of the source tree. No patch script or helper program is required before compiling.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- Git
- CMake 3.15+
- Visual Studio with the Desktop development with C++ workload
- Steinberg ASIO SDK

SonoBus's existing CMake configuration expects the ASIO SDK at:

```text
../asiosdk/common
```

relative to the repository root. A typical layout is:

```text
ParentFolder\
├─ sonobus\
└─ asiosdk\
   └─ common\
      ├─ iasiodrv.h
      └─ ...
```

The ASIO requirement comes from the existing SonoBus Windows build; it is not introduced by this fork's tray/autostart features.

## Clone

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/PixelCat55/sonobus.git
cd sonobus
```

## Configure

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
```

## Build the standalone application

```powershell
cmake --build build --config Release --target SonoBus_Standalone --parallel 2
```

The resulting Release build contains the normal SonoBus standalone application plus this fork's native Windows tray integration and **Start with Windows (minimized to tray)** option.

## GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/build-windows-native-tray.yml` performs the same x64 standalone build automatically. It provisions the ASIO SDK, verifies the fork-specific Windows source integration, configures CMake, builds `SonoBus_Standalone`, and uploads `SonoBus.exe` as an artifact.

A fresh clone of current `main` requires no fork-specific migration or patch step.
