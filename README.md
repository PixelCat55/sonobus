# SonoBus — QoL and Bug Fixes Fork

> **Unofficial community fork of [SonoBus](https://github.com/sonosaurus/sonobus)** focused on practical quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and lightweight background operation.
>
> The original SonoBus project, application, design, and upstream work belong to **Jesse Chappell / Sonosaurus and the SonoBus contributors**. This fork does **not** claim ownership of the original project. It only maintains clearly documented modifications on top of the upstream source.

This fork keeps SonoBus recognizable and compatible while adding practical Windows and Linux QoL features, targeted bug fixes, and conservative efficiency improvements for users who leave SonoBus running in the background.

## What this fork adds

### Native minimize to system tray

On the Windows and Linux standalone applications:

- Pressing **Minimize** removes the SonoBus window from the normal taskbar or panel and keeps it running in the system tray.
- **Left-click** the SonoBus tray icon to restore the window.
- **Right-click** the tray icon for **Open SonoBus** and **Exit SonoBus**.
- The normal window **Close (X)** button still exits SonoBus.
- Audio, networking, and the SonoBus process continue running while the window is hidden.
- The implementation is built directly into `SonoBus.exe`; there is no tray helper or companion process.

### Start with the desktop, minimized to tray

The standalone application's **Settings → OPTIONS** tab includes a platform-specific startup option:

- **Start with Windows (minimized to tray)**
- **Start with Linux (minimized to tray)**

When enabled:

- SonoBus starts automatically when the current desktop user signs in.
- It starts directly in the system tray instead of opening the main window.
- No administrator/root privileges, service, scheduled task, or helper executable are required.
- Disabling the option removes the startup entry again.

The startup entry follows the exact location of the `SonoBus.exe` that enabled it. If the executable is later moved, disable and re-enable the option from the new location.

For full platform behavior and implementation notes, see **[WINDOWS_FEATURES.md](WINDOWS_FEATURES.md)** and **[LINUX_FEATURES.md](LINUX_FEATURES.md)**.

## Builds

The repository includes Windows x64 and Linux x64 GitHub Actions workflows that build the standalone application and publish platform-specific artifacts.

The workflows verify the fork-specific desktop features, provision the platform build dependencies, configure CMake, build `SonoBus_Standalone`, and upload the resulting executable packages.

There is **no patching step required** after cloning this fork. The Windows additions are part of the source tree itself.

For manual compilation details, see **[BUILD_WINDOWS.md](BUILD_WINDOWS.md)** or **[BUILD_LINUX.md](BUILD_LINUX.md)**.

## Fork philosophy

This is intentionally a **QoL and Bug Fixes fork**, not a replacement project or a rebranding of SonoBus. The goals are to:

- keep upstream SonoBus recognizable and compatible;
- make practical QoL improvements and fix reproducible defects where useful;
- preserve original copyright and attribution;
- keep background operation lightweight without compromising audio/network behavior;
- keep every fork-specific change visible in source control;
- remain under the same open-source licensing terms as the upstream project.

A chronological record of fork-specific modifications is maintained in **[FORK_CHANGES.md](FORK_CHANGES.md)**.

# About SonoBus

**The information below describes the original SonoBus project.**

SonoBus is an easy-to-use application for streaming high-quality, low-latency peer-to-peer audio between devices over the internet or a local network.

Choose a unique group name, optionally add a password, and connect multiple people for music, remote sessions, podcasts, and other real-time audio use. SonoBus provides fine-grained control over latency, audio quality, and the overall mix, and includes recording, input processing, network statistics, and other audio tools.

SonoBus works as a standalone application on macOS, Windows, iOS, and Linux, and as an audio plugin on supported desktop platforms.

## Important usage notes from upstream

SonoBus does not use echo cancellation or automatic noise reduction in order to maintain high audio quality. If you have a live microphone signal, headphones are recommended to prevent echo and feedback.

For the lowest practical network latency, a wired Ethernet connection is preferred. Wi-Fi can introduce additional jitter and packet loss, requiring larger safety buffers and therefore higher latency.

SonoBus does not currently encrypt its audio/data communication. Audio is sent directly between users peer-to-peer; the connection server is primarily used so members of a group can find each other.

## Official SonoBus resources

- **Official project:** [sonobus.net](https://sonobus.net)
- **Original source repository:** [sonosaurus/sonobus](https://github.com/sonosaurus/sonobus)
- **This unofficial fork:** `PixelCat55/sonobus`

For official SonoBus releases, platform packages, general documentation, and upstream support, use the official SonoBus project resources above. Fork-specific Windows behavior should be reported against this fork rather than assumed to be part of upstream SonoBus.

## Building the upstream project

SonoBus uses CMake 3.15 or newer. The upstream repository contains its JUCE/AOO source dependencies and platform-specific project files. Platform build requirements still apply.

### macOS

With CMake and Xcode installed, the upstream helper scripts can be used:

```sh
./setupcmake.sh
./buildcmake.sh
```

### Windows

The Windows build requires CMake, Visual Studio/MSVC, and the ASIO SDK expected by the SonoBus CMake configuration. This fork's GitHub Actions workflow handles those requirements automatically for its x64 standalone build.

For a reproducible manual build of **this fork**, use **[BUILD_WINDOWS.md](BUILD_WINDOWS.md)** instead of relying on older helper-script assumptions.

### Linux

For a reproducible build of this fork on Linux Mint or another Debian-based distribution, see [`BUILD_LINUX.md`](BUILD_LINUX.md). The original upstream-oriented instructions remain in [`linux/BUILDING.md`](linux/BUILDING.md).

## License and third-party software

SonoBus was written by **Jesse Chappell** and is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0**, with the repository's existing license exception where applicable. The full texts are provided in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and [`LICENSE_EXCEPTION`](LICENSE_EXCEPTION).

This fork preserves those license and copyright notices. Fork-specific modifications are distributed under the same applicable open-source terms; modifying this repository does not transfer ownership of the original SonoBus work to the maintainer of this fork.

SonoBus uses JUCE, AOO (Audio over OSC), Opus, and other third-party components whose own notices and licenses remain applicable.

## Upstream credits

Thanks belong to the original SonoBus authors and contributors, including the upstream development, documentation, testing, translation, JUCE/AOO, and other dependency contributors.

Original upstream credits include:

- **Jesse Chappell** — SonoBus author / maintainer
- **Christof Ressi** — AOO library
- **Sten Wessel** — Soundboard feature
- **Hannah Schellekens** — Soundboard feature
- **Michael Eskin** — documentation
- **Tony Becker** — documentation
- **RelationLife (Taewook Yang)** — translation

This fork's additions are intentionally documented separately in [`FORK_CHANGES.md`](FORK_CHANGES.md) so upstream work and fork-specific work remain easy to distinguish.
